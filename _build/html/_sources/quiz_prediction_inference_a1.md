# Answer 1 and Question 2

>Identify poor households eligible for welfare program based on the
house characteristics (#rooms, sqm, neighborhood) and observable
durable goods (tv, fridge, toilet).

__Prediction__

Why? You need a training data where you know exactly the poverty status of each family plus the house characteristics and other observables. Then, you train the model to predict the poverty status based on the predictors. You are not interested in whether the prediction model uses the number of tv-sets or toilets to predict poverty. You are interested how accurately these predictors when working together can predict poverty.

# Question 2

product sales.**
