>Measure GDP growth from sattelite night luminosity images


__Prediction__

Why? You have a sample of the GDP growth by country and you have data on changes in luminosity by country. Can you extrapolate the latest changes in luminosity to predict what the GDP growth would be in each country based on the past data? Yes. You train a prediction model, because the GDP growth is an outcome that is observed exactly, i.e., the ground truth is known.
