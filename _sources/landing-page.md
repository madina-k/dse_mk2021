## Course organization
In this book, you will find video lectures, tutorials, and links to useful materials. The course materials will be published every week. 

Each Friday, we will discuss the studied material at a zoom session. During these sessions, you can ask me clarifying questions.  

The *first two weeks* of the course is dedicated to learning prediction models, and the *last two weeks* to learning how to apply prediction models for causal inference.
