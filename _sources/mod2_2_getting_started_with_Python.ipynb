    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages for a number of reasons:\n",
    "- It’s open-source\n",
    "- It has a large standard library and a massive (and growing!) ecosystem of packages (collections of code), including those used for scientific computing\n",
    "- It’s user-friendly\n",
    "- It has a large and active online community for knowledge-sharing and trouble-shooting when you get stuck\n",

    "\n",
    "**We highly recommend you install Python with `pyenv` and use a virtual environment for this tutorial.** Even if you already have Python on your computer, using `pyenv` and a virtual environment will ensure you can install and manage the packages we’ll be using easily and it won’t interfere with the Python installation you already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package management\n",
    "We mentioned that large and growing ecosystem of Python packages, which really makes this a powerful language. Thanks to these open-source packages, many tasks we’ll conduct in this tutorial will use code already written for the task, so you don’t have to write out the source code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these packages often depend on each other in various ways and are updated frequently. If you didn’t have a way to manage packages and dependencies, things might break and it becomes a frustrating experience. Fortunately,there are package managers available for this.\n",

Don't worry if you get stuck, this can be tricky for beginners, but understanding the software you have \"under the hood\" is a big part of programming for data science. You may not have to build these tools, but it helps to understand them!\n",

    "## Virtual environments (optional, but highly recommended)\n",
    "As you dig into programming, you will realize different projects need different versions and configurations of software, contained within an “environment.” It makes life a lot easier to create specific “virtual environments” on your computer that contain all the code you need for a project without interfering with other projects. \n",

    "For example, open a terminal (CLI) window and navigate to the location you want to have this tutorial project on your computer, perhaps in a new folder (e.g. /home/<username>/projects/onltutorial, etc.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then enter the following, replacting \"3.8.2\" with your Python version as installed with `pyenv` and \"onl\" with whatever you name your environment:\n",

There are different ways to manage dependencies and it is an important part of programming with open source programs (anything, really). A simple way to track your dependencies is with a `requirements.txt` file.\n",

There are a lot of advantages to using IDEs, especially if you’re building more complicated software applications; however, for this tutorial, we’ll be executing fairly simple routines and can do this from Jupyter notebooks. In fact, this tutorial is contained in Jupyter notebooks!"
