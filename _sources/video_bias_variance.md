```{note}
The material in this video is based on Chapter 2.2 of the ISLR book (cited in the teaching materials for this course). I encourage you to read Chapter 2 to learn more details about the bias-variance trade-off.

After watching the video lecture, please, try answering the following questions:

**When a more flexible model will be preferred over a less flexible model?**

- the shape of Conditional Expectation Function in the population is linear in parameters
- the shape of  Conditional Expectation Function in the population is highly non-linear in parameters
- the variance of noise around the Conditional Expectation Function in the population is high
- the variance of noise is low
- the number of observations per number of parameters ($n/p$) is high
- ($n/p$) is low
