# Predict height

Now, suppose you are on a tv-show called "Predict", which gives prizes to anyone who most accurately predicts the height of some newly selected musician from the Vienna conservatory. So you want to minimize the distance between some new $h_i$ and your guess $\hat{h}$: 

$$\min_{\hat{h}} E(h_i-\hat{h})$$

The only information that is given to the contestants is these five measures, that you already saw.

>150cm, 160cm, 170cm, 180cm, 190cm

What would be your best prediction? 

You will find the answer on the next page, but take a wild guess first!
