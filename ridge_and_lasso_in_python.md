# Links: Ridge and Lasso in Python

Please, see [this notebook](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python/blob/master/Notebooks/Chapter%206.ipynb) by Jordi Warmenhoven who translated the tutorial from Chapter 6 of the ISLR textbook into python code. The same tutorial on which I based this week's tutorial.

If you want to have more exercises in Python with the scikit learn library, I recommend [Chapter 2 on linear models](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/regression-2?ex=1) in the datacamp course on supervised machine learning.
